We are excited to share that we’ve made significant progress on our project. Here are the key highlights:

- We’ve pushed  **4 machine learning models**, all of which are in **100% working condition**.
- For each  ML model, you will find a sample provided in their respective README files.



### Machine Learning Models Developed:
1. **Route Optimization**  
2. **Traffic Prediction**  
3. **CO2 Emissions Modeling**  
4. **Demand Prediction**

### Key Features of the Demand Prediction Model:
- **Fuel Consumption Prediction**
- **Peak Hours Prediction**
- **Taxi Fare Prediction**
- **Demand Prediction**

All our machine learning models and IoT systems are fully functional and ready for integration.

We are enthusiastic about bringing this project to its final stages and delivering a **complete and optimized public transportation solution**!
